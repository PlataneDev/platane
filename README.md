This project is done in a **university context** for the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi for a mobile computing course ([8INF257](https://programmes.uqac.ca/8INF257)) done by Sorelle Audrey Kamkuimo, Ph.D ([sorelleaudrey1_kamkuimokengne@uqac.ca]()).

The objective of this course is: "to bring the students to the heart of the problem of design and mobile application development. The student will be able to effectively exploit the multiple sensors of mobile devices (e.g. phones, tablets, etc.) in order to offer appropriate services to the
context of use".

# Genesis of the idea

The genesis of the idea of Platane started from two observations, the first is social: nowadays **travel and opportunities to live abroad** are made more and more possible and easy. The second observation relates to the functioning of other social networks, indeed all these applications always provide a single space for a single functionality. For example, we generally have all our conversations grouped together in the same place, even if it means having **to mix up all the types of relationships** we have (family, professional, etc.).

Our goal was to find a way to keep a **strong social bond** with loved ones in the context of a long-distance relationship. For this we imagined an application allowing to create a space shared between 2 users, this one providing them **a feeling of proximity and sharing**. This common space is made up of several sections, each of which has the role of bringing together **digital content** linking the 2 people. This operation aims to really highlight complicity and intimacy, the different types of relationships being well separated.

# Features

The main functionalities that we want to put in place also represent the different sections of each space:
* an integrated **messaging system** allowing you to converse
* a shared **photo gallery** that can keep souvenir photos in one place
* a **calendar** that can be synchronized with that of the user's phone, events made together or the date of future reunions, for example, can be placed there
* a **film library** containing the cinematographic moments shared by the 2 people, it can use the IMDb API to retrieve the names of the films and series
* a **playlist** allowing songs to be discovered, it could be linked via the Spotify API
* a **map of the world** showing the locations** of the 2 users as well as the distance separating them.

We also thought of several secondary features for our application:
* the possibility of choosing a **color by type of relationship**, which allows users to recognize at a glance the links that unite them to their contacts
* the functionality of creating **groups** between multiple users, which simplifies communication and information sharing with larger groups of people such as family or groups of friends.
* the possibility of sending a **vibration** to people with a connected watch connected to the application. This fun feature is intended to remind physical contact even from a distance and to show that you are thinking of the person concerned in an unexpected way.
* the ability to add a **profile photo** as well as a 3D profile photo, as with Apple's Memoji.
